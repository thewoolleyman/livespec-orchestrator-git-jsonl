# capture-spec-drift

Asymmetric counterpart to `capture-impl-gaps`. Where impl-gap detection
is mechanical, drift detection is heuristic — the implementation may
have evolved beyond what the spec documents, in ways no static
pattern-match can flag. The skill drives an LLM-assisted comparison
between the canonical Specification (via the Spec Reader) and the
working impl tree, surfaces each candidate finding to the user, and
hands the confirmed findings off to `/livespec:propose-change`
via the cross-boundary handoff (red-edge handoff 1 per
livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md §"Cross-boundary handoffs").

## Pre-requisites

- A `<spec-root>/` containing ratified spec content at the path
  declared in `.livespec.jsonc` (default: `SPECIFICATION/`).
- The consumer project's impl tree (the rest of the repo besides
  `<spec-root>/`).
- livespec installed and accessible — the
  `/livespec:propose-change` cross-boundary handoff requires it.

## Flow

### Step 1 — Load the comparison baseline

Use the Spec Reader to load the current specification:

```python
from livespec_impl_plaintext.spec_reader import read_current_specification
from pathlib import Path

snapshot = read_current_specification(spec_root=Path("SPECIFICATION"))
```

The snapshot is the "what the project says it does." The impl tree is
"what the project actually does." Drift is the delta.

### Step 2 — Survey the impl tree

Scan the consumer project's impl tree (excluding `<spec-root>/`,
`.venv/`, `_vendor/`, generated artifacts) for:

- Public API surfaces (function signatures, CLI flag declarations,
  config schema entries, REST/gRPC endpoint definitions, etc.).
- Behavior documented inline in code (docstrings, comments tagged
  `# spec:`, etc.).
- Tests that assert behavior visible to external consumers.

For each candidate, ask:

> Is this behavior reflected in the Specification? (yes / no / partial / skip)

- `yes` — no drift; move on.
- `no` — drift exists; behavior is not in the spec. Proceed to Step 3.
- `partial` — drift exists; spec captures some but not all of the
  behavior. Proceed to Step 3 with a "refinement" framing.
- `skip` — defer judgment.

### Step 3 — Per-finding propose-change handoff

For each `no` / `partial` finding:

1. Draft a one-sentence proposed-change framing the missing behavior.
2. Surface it to the user with the recommended action ("file a propose-change
   targeting `<spec-root>/`?").
3. On consent, invoke the cross-boundary handoff:

```bash
/livespec:propose-change --spec-target SPECIFICATION/ --topic <slug> --body <draft>
```

The proposed-change file lands under `<spec-root>/proposed_changes/`
awaiting a subsequent `/livespec:revise` pass.

### Step 4 — Summary

When all candidates are processed, print a summary:

- N impl behaviors surveyed
- M classified as drift, of which K were filed as propose-changes
- S skipped

## Important properties

- **LLM-assisted, user-in-the-loop** — every drift finding requires
  explicit user consent before a propose-change is filed. The skill
  does NOT auto-file.
- **Read-only on the impl tree** — the skill never modifies source
  code. Spec authorship happens through `/livespec:propose-change`,
  not here.
- **Spec-side write goes through the cross-boundary handoff** — this
  plugin never writes to `<spec-root>/proposed_changes/` directly. The
  handoff invocation is the surface contract.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does NOT modify the impl tree.
- Does NOT modify the spec tree directly. Routes through
  `/livespec:propose-change`.
- Does NOT detect spec→impl gaps. That's `capture-impl-gaps`.
- Does NOT auto-accept findings. User confirms every handoff.
