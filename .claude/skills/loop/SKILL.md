description: Layer 3 orchestration driver for livespec-impl-plaintext. Composes /livespec:next and /livespec-impl-plaintext:next, dispatches to the appropriate heavyweight skill, runs the project's janitor (typically `just check` plus `/livespec:doctor`) as a hard gate, and loops until the queue drains or the configured budget exhausts. Hand-tuned per repo — local divergence is expected and exempt from copier-update drift detection.

# Layer 3 loop driver — livespec-impl-plaintext starter

This skill is the project-local Layer 3 orchestration driver per
`livespec/SPECIFICATION/spec.md` §"Three-layer orchestration
architecture" and `non-functional-requirements.md` §"Layer 3 loop
driver — required shape and discipline".

It is generated from
`livespec/templates/impl-plugin/.claude/skills/loop/SKILL.md.jinja`
as a STARTER scaffold. Per
`livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` §"Shared content sync —
copier template", this file is EXEMPT from `copier update --dry-run`
drift detection — local divergence is expected and load-bearing.

## Contract

The driver MUST:

1. **Accept a `mode` parameter** with at minimum two recognized
   values:
   - `interactive` — human approves spec-side mutations and reviews
     each work-item closure. MUST be the default for spec-side
     dispatches.
   - `autonomous` — driver runs end-to-end without per-iteration
     approval; human review happens at PR boundaries. MUST be the
     default for impl-side dispatches.

2. **Accept a `budget` parameter** bounding the loop. MUST recognize
   at minimum one of: iteration count, wallclock duration, token
   consumption. Default budget is implementation-defined but MUST be
   finite (no unbounded loops).

3. **Run the janitor as a hard gate** on every mutating iteration.
   Janitor for this repo: `just check` plus
   `/livespec:doctor`. A non-zero janitor exit MUST prevent
   the commit for that iteration. Recovery policy (retry, escalate
   to interactive, halt, etc.) is per-project.

4. **Emit a structured iteration journal** recording each iteration's
   pick (from `next`), dispatched skill, janitor result, commit SHA
   (or rollback), and exit reason. Machine-readable for post-hoc
   audit.

## Cross-side composition

Compose `/livespec:next` (spec-side ranking) and
`/livespec-impl-plaintext:next` (impl-side ranking) into a unified
"what to work on now" answer. The weighting between spec-side and
impl-side work is a per-project judgment — neither `livespec`
nor `livespec-impl-plaintext` bakes one in. Adjust the heuristic
below to match this repo's bottleneck profile (whether spec
evolution or impl execution is currently load-bearing).

## Starter dispatch table

| Action from `next` | Skill to invoke |
|---|---|
| `revise` (spec-side) | `/livespec:revise` |
| `propose-change` (spec-side) | `/livespec:propose-change` |
| `critique` (spec-side) | `/livespec:critique` |
| `prune-history` (spec-side) | `/livespec:prune-history` |
| `implement` (impl-side) | `/livespec-impl-plaintext:implement` |
| `capture-impl-gaps` (impl-side) | `/livespec-impl-plaintext:capture-impl-gaps` |
| `capture-spec-drift` (impl-side) | `/livespec-impl-plaintext:capture-spec-drift` |
| `process-memos` (impl-side) | `/livespec-impl-plaintext:process-memos` |
| `none` | exit cleanly |

## Hand-tune freely

Customize the dispatch table, mode/budget defaults, janitor
invocation, escalation policy, commit conventions, and journal
format to fit this repo. The starter exists to anchor the
contract; the shape is whatever serves this project.
