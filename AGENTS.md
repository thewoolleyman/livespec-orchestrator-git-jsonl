# Agent instructions

This file is the canonical agent-orientation surface for this repo;
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it — never maintain a separate copy.
The sections through "Red-Green-Replay commit protocol" are the livespec
family-universal agent-instruction core (shared by every family member via
the impl-plugin template); repo-specific guidance is additive on top.

## Repository mutation protocol

**Every change to a tracked file happens in an ISOLATED git worktree under
`~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`, never on the shared primary checkout's working
tree.** Multiple agent sessions share the one primary checkout; committing
directly on it causes cross-track collisions (one session's uncommitted churn
breaks another's gates), orphaned worktrees, and detached-HEAD incidents.
Leaving the primary dirty, committing on it, orphaning a worktree, or asking
the user whether to commit are workflow failures — not acceptable stopping
points.

This rule is **mechanically enforced** by the STRUCTURAL commit-refuse hook —
the canonical body that `just bootstrap` installs (via `just
install-commit-refuse-hooks`, which REUSES the shared `livespec-dev-tooling`
installer module `python -m livespec_dev_tooling.install_commit_refuse_hooks` —
the SINGLE source of the hook body, no repo-vendored copy) at
`.git/hooks/pre-commit`, `.git/hooks/pre-push`, and `.git/hooks/commit-msg`. It blocks any `git commit`
or `git push` made on the primary checkout UNLESS `git config
livespec.sandboxExempt` is `true` (the explicit, declared exemption a Fabro
sandbox — a fresh full clone that is structurally a primary but legitimately
commits during Red-Green-Replay — sets on itself), then delegates to
mise-managed lefthook so the per-hook gates still fire. Linked worktrees pass —
the hook distinguishes primary from linked with portable, config-free
detection: `git rev-parse --git-dir` and `--git-common-dir` resolve to the SAME
path on the primary (refuse) and DIFFER in a linked worktree (the git-dir is
`.git/worktrees/<name>`; allow). It is armed on install — there is no arming
step and so no fail-open window — and needs no `git config` key beyond the
`livespec.sandboxExempt` exemption marker; the commit-msg install covers
`git commit --allow-empty`, which lefthook skips at pre-commit when there are
zero staged files.

The portable worktree-lifecycle helper `dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh` carries
the four verbs the discipline needs — `create`, `hydrate`, `land`, `reap` —
and uses the same primary-vs-linked test as the gate. It is pure-git and
ecosystem-neutral (it shells out to `git` only).

Drive the four verbs through `just` — the mandated runner. The `just
worktree-create` / `worktree-hydrate` / `worktree-land` / `worktree-reap`
recipes call `dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh` directly and carry no logic of
their own; the core stays the single source of truth. `just` and `lefthook`
are mandated non-functionally across the fleet + adopters (the Conformance
Pattern: Installer = a `just` recipe; commit gate wired via `lefthook → just
check`) and never enter livespec core's public functional surface or the
`/livespec:*` skills. If this repo's ecosystem has a native tool, expose it as
a STRICT PASS-THROUGH onto these recipes — never an alternative runner: a Rust
repo wires `cargo xtask worktree create` → `just worktree-create`; a
JavaScript repo wires package.json `"wt:create": "just worktree-create"`.

1. **Create the worktree.** Branch from the latest default branch into a
   dedicated worktree under `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>` (NEVER as a peer of
   first-class clones):

   ```bash
   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh create <branch>
   cd ~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>
   ```

   `worktree-lib.sh create` fetches `origin`, adds the worktree, and runs the
   hydrate hook. `just bootstrap` registers `~/.worktrees` as one of mise's
   `trusted_config_paths`, so a freshly created worktree's `.mise.toml` is
   auto-trusted and the first `mise exec` inside it never stalls on a "config
   not trusted" prompt.

2. **Hydrate (if this repo needs it).** "Hydrate" means prepare the fresh
   worktree so the repo's checks and tooling can run inside it; what that
   entails is ecosystem-specific (Python: create a `.venv`; JavaScript:
   populate `node_modules` including workspace sub-packages; Rust: warm/share
   the build cache — crates already live in `$CARGO_HOME`, so the per-worktree
   cost is the cold `target/` recompile, shared via sccache or a shared
   `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`). The shipped `dev-tooling/worktree-hydrate.sh` is the
   ecosystem-correct hydration the copier template stamped from this repo's
   `ecosystem` answer — adjust its `hydrate_cmd` if this repo's installer
   differs, or override at runtime via `WORKTREE_HYDRATE_OVERRIDE="<command>"`
   (just the dependency step) or `WORKTREE_HYDRATE_HOOK="<command>"` (the whole
   hook). `worktree-lib.sh create` runs the hook automatically; re-run it
   standalone with `./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh hydrate`.

3. **Edit and commit in the worktree.** Use `mise exec -- git commit ...` and
   `mise exec -- git push ...` so the mise-managed lefthook hooks actually run.
   Never pass `--no-verify`; if a hook fails, fix the cause or halt with the
   failure.

4. **Land the branch.** Rebase onto the latest default branch, then land via
   this repo's chosen path (PR/merge, merge-queue, or direct push — the
   contract is mandated, the land tool is not):

   ```bash
   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh land   # fetch + rebase, then reports the next step
   ```

5. **Clean up (always — leaving an orphan is a failure).** After the branch
   lands, refresh the primary to the latest default branch, then reap the
   worktree:

   ```bash
   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh reap                 # dry-run (default): reports the plan
   ./dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh reap --execute       # remove merged + clean worktrees
   ```

   `reap` never touches the primary checkout or the worktree it runs from, and
   never removes a dirty or unmerged worktree without `--force`. NEVER run it
   while another agent is actively working in a worktree — `--force` discards
   uncommitted changes. Reap only at session start, after a landed branch is
   confirmed merged and its agent exited, or at loop end.

Do not leave orphaned worktrees. If a session must stop before cleanup, record
the active worktree path, branch, PR, validation state, and next action in the
relevant handoff document.

### Server-side enforcement (branch protection)

The local commit-refuse hook is LOCALLY bypassable (`git commit --no-verify`,
or simply never installed). GitHub branch protection is the server-enforced
backstop: the default branch advances only via PR/merge, and
direct + force pushes to it are rejected by GitHub itself. Establish it once on
a fresh repo (needs an admin-scoped `gh` token):

```bash
just protect-default-branch   # idempotent + non-weakening; FORCE=1 resets to baseline
```

`just check-branch-protection` is the VERIFIER (the "tripwire"): fail-closed
when it can read protection, but capability-aware — it SKIPs with a named notice
when it cannot (no `gh`, no admin token, or a non-GitHub origin), so it never
makes `just check` flaky. It is wired into `just check` and honours the
`LIVESPEC_BRANCH_PROTECTION_CHECK` severity lever (`fail` [default] | `warn` |
`skip`) — the explicit, declared exemption. The authoritative bite belongs to
the conformance/orchestrator tier, where an admin token exists. Both verbs
delegate to the portable `dev-tooling/branch-protection.sh`.

## Agent prerequisites for plugin work

When investigating or changing anything related to the Claude Code plugin
installation, marketplace, or distribution, establish execution context FIRST —
do not assume how the system works:

1. Run `claude plugin marketplace list` to see which marketplaces are configured
   and whether they point to local files or remote repos. Changes to a local
   `marketplace.json` do NOT affect installs from a remote GitHub marketplace.
2. Trace where the actual install command fetches from (local vs remote) before
   changing anything, and verify your change affects that code path.
3. For remote marketplaces, push to GitHub then test; for local, use
   `/plugin marketplace add ./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Never test local
   changes against a remote marketplace and assume they apply.

## Codex dogfooding (OpenAI Codex CLI/TUI)

This repo's `/livespec:*` and orchestrator surfaces can ALSO be dogfooded from
OpenAI Codex CLI/TUI, not just Claude Code. Unlike the Claude path (plugins
enabled PER PROJECT via a committed `.claude/settings.json`), Codex plugin
enablement is **HOST-WIDE**: each registration persists in `~/.codex/config.toml`
and applies to every project on the host. Codex offers no project-scoped plugin
enablement, so there is no committed-settings analogue for the Codex path.

Install the three plugins host-wide — livespec CORE (the artifact carrier that
ships the spec-side prose and wrappers), the `livespec-driver-codex` Codex Driver
(which supplies the `/livespec:*` operation surface over core's prose), and THIS
repo's own orchestrator plugin (whose name is declared in this repo's
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — e.g. `livespec-orchestrator-beads-fabro`,
`livespec-orchestrator-git-jsonl`; substitute it for `<orchestrator-plugin>`
below):

```bash
# livespec CORE (spec-side prose + wrappers; no skills of its own):
codex plugin marketplace add thewoolleyman/livespec
codex plugin add livespec@livespec

# The Codex Driver (supplies the spec-side /livespec:* operation surface):
codex plugin marketplace add thewoolleyman/livespec-driver-codex
codex plugin add livespec@livespec-driver-codex

# This repo's orchestrator plugin (ships its OWN cross-runtime Codex surface):
codex plugin marketplace add thewoolleyman/<orchestrator-plugin>
codex plugin add <orchestrator-plugin>@<orchestrator-plugin>
```

Once installed, Codex operations are driven via `codex exec` and NAME-selected as
`<plugin>:<op>` (e.g. `livespec:next`, `<orchestrator-plugin>:list-work-items`)
rather than as `/`-prefixed slash commands. The distributed Drivers resolve their
prose at runtime — no `AGENTS.md` skill→prose mapping is required. See
`livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` §"Plugin distribution" and
`livespec/SPECIFICATION/non-functional-requirements.md` §"Codex dogfooding
contracts" for the authoritative install and resolution contracts; each
orchestrator plugin's repository owns its own Codex Driver mapping. A temporary
local Codex marketplace registration used for testing MUST be removed afterward
unless you explicitly ask to keep it.

The Codex TUI picker displays skills by short name with the plugin as context.
In `/skills` → `List skills` (or the `@` picker), search the operation name,
for example `next`; the row renders as `next (<orchestrator-plugin>)` with
kind `Skill`. The colon-qualified form `<orchestrator-plugin>:next` is still
valid for prompt / `codex exec` name selection and model-visible skill
references, but it is not the picker row operators should expect.

## Beads runtime prerequisites

This plugin's work-item store is a per-repo beads/Dolt TENANT on the shared
family dolt-server — NOT JSONL files. Installing the plugin does NOT provision
the backend; a clone connects to its tenant only when ALL of the following are
present:

- **`bd` CLI, pinned**, at an absolute path (NEVER the mise shim), with
  `LIVESPEC_BD_PATH` pointing at it.
- **A running Dolt `sql-server`** reachable over **TCP `127.0.0.1:3307`**. Family
  tenants force TCP (not the unix socket); `.beads/config.yaml` carries `dolt.*`
  host/port keys with NO `socket` key.
- **The tenant password** in env as a single **bare `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD`** —
  injected by THIS project's configured env wrapper. A FAMILY tenant shares the
  one family password via the family 1Password Environment wrapper
  `with-livespec-env.sh` (canonical copy at
  `/data/projects/1password-env-wrapper/with-livespec-env.sh`); an INDEPENDENT
  (non-family) tenant injects its own tenant password from its own 1Password
  Environment via its own `with-<project>-env.sh` wrapper. Either way `bd`
  consumes the same bare var — there is NO per-tenant
  `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD_<tenant>` variable and NO per-tenant→bare mapping. Real
  isolation comes from the per-tenant SQL user + DB-scoped grant, not from
  password distinctness or wrapper identity. Secrets are probe-only — `printenv
  NAME | wc -c`, never echo values — and NEVER committed to `.livespec.jsonc` or
  `.beads/`.
- **The `.beads/` pointer files**: `config.yaml` (committed; the `dolt.*` server
  keys) and `metadata.json` (gitignored, regenerable). NEVER run `bd init` inside
  a primary checkout or worktree — it auto-commits and clobbers `.beads/`.

**Run beads commands from the target repo root.** Per-command `bd` resolves its
connection from the current directory's `.beads/config.yaml` (auto-discovery),
NOT from any resolved config object — so run from the intended repo's root, or
`bd` silently operates on the wrong tenant.

**An "Access denied" / "no beads database found" failure almost always means you
are running OUTSIDE the wrapper** (the bare `BEADS_DOLT_PASSWORD` is absent), not
that a secret is missing. Re-run under your project's configured env wrapper
(`with-<project>-env.sh`) -- `<command>`. Never hand-hunt the secret or reach
around the seam with raw `mysql` / `dolt` / `sudo`.

## Daily commands

- `just bootstrap` — first-touch setup on a fresh clone; idempotently installs
  the structural commit-refuse hook (the canonical body from the shared
  `livespec-dev-tooling` installer module, via `just install-commit-refuse-hooks`
  — no repo-vendored copy) at `.git/hooks/pre-commit` + `.git/hooks/pre-push` +
  `.git/hooks/commit-msg`, ensures the
  worktree-discipline shell scripts (`dev-tooling/worktree-lib.sh`,
  `dev-tooling/worktree-hydrate.sh`, `dev-tooling/branch-protection.sh`) stay
  executable, installs lefthook hooks, resolves plugin dependencies, creates
  `~/.worktrees`, and registers it in mise's `trusted_config_paths` so every
  worktree (created at `~/.worktrees/<repo>/<branch>`) auto-trusts its
  `.mise.toml`. The worktree-only mutation protocol is enforced by that hook
  body, which refuses a commit/push on the primary checkout (armed on install;
  honours `livespec.sandboxExempt`) and otherwise delegates to mise-managed
  lefthook (commit on the primary checkout → blocked; linked worktrees →
  allowed).
- `just check` — the full enforcement aggregate (lint, types, tests, coverage,
  AST checks). It is the load-bearing safety net; it runs locally, in pre-push,
  and in CI.

## Revise co-edit discipline — `tests/heading-coverage.json`

Every revise pass that adds, changes, or removes a `## ` heading in any spec file
MUST update `tests/heading-coverage.json` in the same change (via the revise
`resulting_files[]` mechanism) so the heading-coverage map stays in lockstep with
the spec. Diff the proposed `## ` heading set against the current spec file's H2
set; add an entry (`test` MAY be the literal `"TODO"` with a non-empty `reason`)
for each new heading, and drop entries for removed headings.

## Red-Green-Replay commit protocol

Product `.py` changes are committed via a 2-step single-commit TDD ritual,
enforced by the `red_green_replay` commit-refuse hook (it inspects the staged
tree and writes `TDD-*` trailers). The final result is ONE commit carrying the
test, the impl, and both trailer sets.

1. **Red commit.** Stage the test file ALONE — no impl — and commit with a
   `fix:`/`feat:` subject. The hook runs pytest on the staged tree; the staged
   test MUST fail on pytest (non-zero exit). An `ImportError` or a collection
   error counts as a failure to the hook, BUT you SHOULD prefer a genuine
   assertion failure so Red proves the behavior is actually unimplemented
   rather than merely unimportable — see the new-module stub technique below.
   It records `TDD-Red-*` trailers (test path, failure reason, test-file
   checksum, output checksum, captured-at).
   - Gotcha: the impl must be UNMODIFIED on disk at the Red commit, because the
     hook's pytest reads the on-disk module. If the impl already carries the
     change the test passes, and the hook rejects with `test-passed-at-red`.
2. **Green amend.** Stage the impl and run `git commit --amend`. The hook sees
   the `TDD-Red-*` trailers + the staged impl, re-runs the SAME test (now
   passing), and records `TDD-Green-*` trailers. The test file bytes MUST be
   byte-identical across the Red→Green pair; to change the test, author a fresh
   Red commit.

### New-module stub technique (avoiding false reds)

When the impl module under test does NOT exist yet, the natural Red would be an
`ImportError` or a collection error rather than an assertion failure. The hook
accepts that as a failing Red, but it does not prove the behavior is
unimplemented — only that the module is unimportable. To make Red fail on a
genuine assertion instead:

1. At Red time, create the impl module as a minimal **stub** on disk — enough
   that the test imports and runs, but its assertion FAILS (e.g. a function
   that returns a wrong/sentinel value, or raises `NotImplementedError` only
   when that still yields an assertion failure rather than a collection error).
2. The stub must NOT make the test pass — a passing test at Red trips the
   hook's `test-passed-at-red` gate.
3. Then the **Green amend** replaces the stub with the real implementation that
   makes the assertion pass.

This keeps Red honest: it proves the behavior is unimplemented, not merely that
the module is missing.

### Execution gotchas

Three failure modes that cost dispatched agents real time:

1. **Multi-test-file Red.** The Red commit must stage EXACTLY ONE test file
   (zero impl). The commit-msg `red_green_replay` hook rejects more than one
   staged test file with `multi-test-file`, AND lefthook's pre-commit only takes
   the fast coverage-skip Red path when `test_count == 1 && impl_count == 0`
   (otherwise it runs full `just check` and fails at <100% coverage). When a
   change needs multiple new/changed test files, stage only ONE at Red (a genuine
   failing assertion), then add the remaining test files + the impl + ride-along
   docs at the Green `--amend`. (The old `LIVESPEC_PRECOMMIT_RED_MODE` env
   override is gone.)
2. **Preserve the Red trailer block at Green.** On the Green `git commit
   --amend`, do NOT pass a fresh `-m` that overwrites the message — that wipes the
   inline `TDD-Red-*` trailers the hook wrote at Red. For a commit that touches a
   PRODUCT-IMPL path, the pre-push *range* replay check greps the FINAL commit body
   for BOTH `TDD-Red-Test-File-Checksum:` AND `TDD-Green-Verified-At:`; if the Red
   block is gone, the push is rejected. Use `--amend --no-edit` (or re-include BOTH
   trailer blocks). The Red and Green test-file bytes must stay byte-identical.
   **SCOPE — do not read this clause as unconditional:**
   `red_green_replay._commit_violates` derives `product_paths` from the same
   `_IMPL_PREFIXES` tuple the commit-msg leg uses and returns early when that list
   is empty, so a commit touching NO product-impl `.py` is EXEMPT from the
   both-trailers requirement rather than passing it. A dangling Red block on such a
   commit is harmless. NEVER hand-forge a `TDD-Green-*` trailer to satisfy a check
   that cannot fire — read `_IMPL_PREFIXES` and confirm whether your paths are even
   in scope before concluding you are blocked.
3. **Working-tree gate, not just staged.** lefthook's pre-commit runs the
   structural / dev-tooling checks over the WORKING TREE, not only the staged set.
   So "revert only the impl for Red" is INSUFFICIENT when the change also ADDS
   files that a working-tree gate inspects (e.g. a new structural check that
   asserts certain dirs are absent, while you've already created those dirs on
   disk). At Red, make the WHOLE working tree master-consistent: move new
   untracked files aside (e.g. to scratch) and revert modified non-test files,
   leaving only the one staged test divergent; then restore everything for the
   Green `--amend`.

**Exempt:** changesets with no product `.py` (docs, spec, work-items, shell,
config) use `chore(...)` / `docs(...)` / `chore(spec):` subjects and skip the
ritual entirely. Always use `mise exec -- git ...` so the hooks fire; never
pass `--no-verify`.
