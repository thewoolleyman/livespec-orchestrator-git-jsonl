# tests/

The pytest suite. Mirrors `.claude-plugin/scripts/bin/` and
`.claude-plugin/scripts/livespec_impl_git_jsonl/` one-to-one:
`tests/bin/` covers the shebang wrappers; `tests/
livespec_impl_git_jsonl/` mirrors the package's directory shape
(top-level `test_<module>.py` for top-level package modules,
subdirectories for subpackages).

Conventions:

- pytest is the test framework. Run the suite + coverage via
  `mise exec -- just check-coverage` (the canonical pytest-running
  aggregate target); the full gate is `mise exec -- just check`.
- 100% line + branch coverage is REQUIRED (inherited from
  `SPECIFICATION/constraints.md` §"Inherited from livespec").
  Pragma exclusions on wrappers are forbidden — cover branches by
  monkeypatching instead.
- Hypothesis property-based tests are required on pure modules
  (`check-pbt-coverage-pure-modules`).
- Every directory under `tests/` (except `fixtures/` subtrees and
  `__pycache__/`) carries a `CLAUDE.md` — enforced by the shared
  `claude_md_coverage` check.
- Data files (e.g. `tests/heading-coverage.json`, the
  heading-coverage registry consumed by the shared
  `heading_coverage` check) live at `tests/<file>` directly;
  subdirectories cover code under test.
- Tests use `tmp_path` for filesystem fixtures, `monkeypatch` to
  stub `os.environ` and the runtime version check, and `capsys` to
  capture stdout/stderr. Happy-path tests that exercise a
  `Path.cwd()` default MUST `monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)` to avoid
  polluting the repo.
