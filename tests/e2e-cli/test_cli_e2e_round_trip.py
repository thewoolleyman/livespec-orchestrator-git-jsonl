"""CLI end-to-end harness wiring for livespec-impl-plaintext (mock tier).

Per `livespec/SPECIFICATION/contracts.md` §"CLI end-to-end harness contract"
(requirement 6 — single canonical implementation in `livespec-dev-tooling`;
requirement 7 — consumer obligations), this repo consumes the imported
`test_workflow_full_round_trip` entry point from
`livespec_dev_tooling.testing.cli_e2e` (shipped at dev-tooling v0.8.0) and
wires it into its own pytest collection against this plugin's per-skill
fixtures under `tests/e2e-cli/fixtures/`.

This is the **mock tier** (`LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=mock`, the default): real
install-shape setup, real structural skill discovery over the on-disk
`.claude-plugin/` tree, the real fail-closed time-bomb coverage gate, and the
real per-skill orchestration loop all run — the ONLY mocked boundary is the
`claude -p` subprocess itself (the `CliRunner` seam), supplied here as a
deterministic injected runner that materializes each fixture's expected files.
The `real` tier (`LIVESPEC_E2E_HARNESS=real`) shells out to the actual
`claude` binary, requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, installs the upstream
`livespec` plugin paired in lockstep, and is NOT part of `just check`.

The plugin slash-command prefix (`livespec-impl-plaintext`) and the skill set
are discovered structurally from `<plugin>/plugin.json` `name` + the
`skills/*/SKILL.md` layout — there is no parallel manifest (contract
requirement 3). Every discovered skill MUST carry a fixture or the coverage
gate fails the run; no skill is exempt (`EXEMPT_SKILLS` is empty).
